                <h3>SIDE BAR</h3>
                <p>Firstly, there is a significant economic value to nature. There are numerous ecosystem services that nature provides that if provided by humans would be extremely costly. Many raw materials that are used by industry originate in nature therefore without a healthy productive natural world they would not form or not to the extent we would like them to. Examples include timber, fish and water.</p>
